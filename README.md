MVP Project Proposal:

"Local Loc Smiths" is a web application that provides potential clients with information on local hairstylists specializing in hairbraiding and hair locs in their chosen area. Users will have the choice of creating a client or a stylist account. Once the account is created, the potential clients can input a location, and an interactive map will display available salons/shops.  For the stylist account, the application will provide the stylists with a platform to connect with and maintain their clientele.

When users hover over a location, a custom popup will display basic location information and rating. Once user clicks on a location,they will be directed to a page with more detailed information such as hours of operation, customer rating, address, pricing and contact information.

"Local Loc Smiths" will use Google Maps API and user ratings to supply information. This will provide users with multiple options enabling users to choose the location(s) that fit their specific needs.

Icebox:

Potential clients will see list of salons/shops in order of rating.

A back office for the stylists to make and maintain their client appointments.

Algorithm for flagging reviews entered.


Sketch of Final Product:

Landing page will display name of web application, description of website, and input form for location information
After inputting location, user will view a pop up with a map. The map will contain pins of locations.  Once user clicks on pin (to request more information), user will be taken to location specific information. This page will allow user to enter reviews.
