Project Manager: Richard Dorleans

MVP Project Proposal:

Local Loc Smiths is a web application that provides potential clients with information on local hairstylists specializing in hairbraiding and hair locs in their chosen area. When potential clients input a location, an interactive map will display available salons/shops.  The application will also provide the stylists with a platform to build up their clientele.

When users hover over a location, a custom popup will display basic location information and rating. Once user clicks on a location,they will be directed to a page with more detailed information such as hours of operation, customer rating, address, and contact information.

Local Loc Smiths will use Google Maps API and user ratings to supply information. This will provide users with multiple options enabling users to choose the location(s) that fit their specific needs.

Icebox:

Potential clients will see list of salons/shops in order of rating.
Creating an account would allow user to save their favorite salons/shops.
A back office for the stylists to make and maintain their client appointments.
Algorithm for flagging reviews entered


Sketch of Final Product:

Landing page will display name of web application, description of website, and input form for location information
After inputting location, user will view a pop up with a map. The map will contain pins of locations
Once user clicks on pin (to request more information), user will be taken to location specific information. This page will allow user to enter reviews.
